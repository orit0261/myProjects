# WikiAnimals

When approaching this, please:
- Take your time, but record of how much time you invested in this - it’s important for us to know.
- Use threading where you see fit.
- Write inline comments as needed, explaining your train of thought, don’t worry about being too verbose.

### Exercise:
Using the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names, write a python program that will output all of the “collateral adjectives” and all of the “animals” which belong to it. If an animal has more than one collateral adjective, use all of them (mentioning it more than once).
- How much time did it take you to write this ?
- What’s the time complexity of the program you just wrote ?

Bonus work (choose whether and as many as you like):
1. Download the picture of each animal into /tmp/ and add a local link when displaying the animals.
1. Write at least 2 test cases for the code you just wrote.
1. Output your results to an html file.

Tips: Feel free to use BeautifulSoup and Requests
